#+TITLE: Thermos UI

The THERMOS web interface.

Builds using scripts in build-src.

* How to build

- For development
  
  1. You need a postgis server to run against.
     There is a nix expression to set one up in [[./dev/pg-server.nix]]
  2. You need a JDK
  3. You need clojure command line tools

  Then you can run

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE sh
  clojure -Adev:server:client dev
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  or
  
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE sh
  clojure -Adev:server:client dev --emacs
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  if you want to develop in emacs with cider.

  If you want to hack on the dependencies locally as well, you can check them out into ../, and do

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE sh
  clojure -Adev:server:client:local-deps dev
  #+END_EXAMPLE

- For production
  
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE sh
  clojure -Adev:server:client jar
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Should spit out a jar in target/

* Configuration

The application has a few config settings, defaults in ~resources/config.edn~.
These are settable through the environment.
