    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>
      THERMOS is a program to help you think about heat networks.
      It is based around two main parts:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        A spatial database containing buildings and roads. THERMOS
        calls these <b>candidates</b>. They are the ingredients it can
        consider when designing a heat network.
      </li>
      <li>
        An optimisation model, which can determine the <b>quality</b>
        of a network made up of some candidates, and can construct a
        network of good quality by choosing some candidates.
      </li>
    </ol>
