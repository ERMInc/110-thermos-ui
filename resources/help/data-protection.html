<b>This service</b>
</p>

<p>
By using THERMOS, you acknowledge and accept these terms and
conditions on behalf of yourself and all individual users from your
organisation:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>All use of THERMOS is subject to these terms and conditions and
to you obtaining the appropriate Subscription. The number of
individual users who are permitted to use THERMOS depends on the
type of Subscription you obtain. Further information including
fee structures is available at: xxxxx</li>

<li>We have the right to immediately terminate this agreement and
remove your access to THERMOS in the event that you (or any of
your individual users) breach these terms. You will not be
entitled to any refund.</li>

<li>Login details must not be shared with anybody else, either inside
or outside your organisation.</li>

<li>We will take reasonable steps to ensure that THERMOS is available
to you. However, we are not providing any warranty, guarantee, or
representation of any kind. THERMOS is provided as is, and as
available. We do not warrant that THERMOS is error free or that
you will be able to operate it without problems or interruptions.</li>

<li>We may update any of the algorithms that comprise THERMOS at any
time, and do not guarantee consistency with previous versions.</li>

<li>You assume sole responsibility for results and conclusions
obtained from your use of THERMOS. We take no responsibility for,
and make no guarantee of the accuracy of, any of the outputs from
THERMOS: you are responsible for ensuring that the outputs are
fit for whatever purpose you may have. We shall have no liability
for any losses resulting from any use of THERMOS. Our total
liability to you shall be limited to the amount of Â£1 plus the
cost of the last Subscription you purchased.</li>

<li>Where possible we will endeavour to back up all user data on a
daily basis, and store it securely off-site.</li>

<li>In the event of a technical fault, we will endeavour to restore
the service within 7 days using the most recent available data
backup, but we do not guarantee how recent this backup will be,
and you are advised to download and backup any critical data on a
regular basis.</li>

<li>Any bugs identified should be reported using the online form at
tool.thermos-project.eu/bug-report. We will consider all bug
reports, but we will not be obliged to take any action in
response.</li>

<li>You may provide suggestions, comments or other feedback regarding
THERMOS, but we will not be obliged to take any action in
response.</li>

<li>Publication of any results which have involved the use of THERMOS
is done entirely at the user's risk. Any work produced as a
result of your use of THERMOS, (including, for example an
academic publication or commercial report) which incorporates or
references outputs from THERMOS, must contain the following
acknowledgement:</li>

<li><b>User Data</b>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>THERMOS does not process very much personal data. To the extent
that it does, we will at all times comply with data protection
laws. We are not interested in spying on you or building business
leads.</li>

<li>The information you can enter about yourself is limited to (1)
your name and (2) your email address (and those of your other
individual users, if any). You must not provide us with any
personal data which you don't have authority to share with us.</li>

<li>We may send emails to you and your registered users for the
purpose of:

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Telling you about changes to the service</li>

<li>Contacting you to ask you about your use of the service, for
the purposes of assessing the impact and value of the project.</li>
</ol></li>

<li>A session cookie will be stored on your computer when you login.
Session cookies are a mechanism needed for the application to
remember that you are logged in.</li>

<li>We also record about each user account:</li>
</ol></li>

<li>When you log in and out of the system,</li>

<li>How many projects, maps, and network models you have run,</li>

<li>Summary statistics about these data, specifically:

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>How many participants are collaborating on projects,</li>

<li>How large the maps and networks you create are, and</li>

<li>The geographic location (bounding box) of your maps and networks.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>
We will not otherwise process or look at your uploaded GIS files,
except insofar as needed to provide the services you request.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Diagnostic information about errors or faults in the system, and</li>

<li>Which other accounts you have worked with; this information is only
used for access control. We are not interested in building a picture
of your social network.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>To the extent that we act as a processor of personal data on your
behalf, we shall:

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>process personal data only in accordance with these terms and
conditions, or on your documented instructions;</li>

<li>implement appropriate measuresto protect against unauthorised
or unlawful personal data processing and against accidental
loss or destruction of or damage to your personal data;</li>

<li>ensure that anyone authorised by us to process your personal
data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under
an appropriate statutory or common law obligation of such;</li>

<li>provide reasonable assistance in responding to any request from
a data subject and ensuring your compliance with your
obligations under data protection laws;</li>

<li>notify you without undue delay on becoming aware of a personal
data breach;</li>

<li>at your choice, delete or return personal data to you after the
end of the provision of services relating to processing and
delete existing copies unless otherwise required by applicable
law;</li>

<li>maintain records to demonstrate our compliance with our data
protection obligations under these Terms and make these
available to you on reasonable request, and allow for and
contribute to audits to assess our compliance.</li>
</ol></li>

<li>You acknowledge that we may appoint processors to process your
personal data, provided that we notify you of any changes and give
you the opportunity to object to such changes, ensure that such
processors are subject to substantially equivalent data protection
obligations to those set out in these Terms and shall remain
responsible for the acts and omissions of such processors.</li>
</ol></li>

<li><b>Data Security</b>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>All data in THERMOS is stored in a physical server on site at CSE.
We keep this server updated and secured to reasonable commercial
standards. Server access is restricted to those indviduals who
need access in order to manage the system.</li>

<li>If you extend project access to someone else, they will be able to
see all the data in that project.</li>

<li>All communications to the server are encrypted, so an attacker
with access to the network infrastructure between your computer
and the server would not be able to view the data transmitted.</li>

<li>Your data is not encrypted at rest on the server, so an attacker
who gained privileged access to the machine could view all data
anyone has uploaded.</li>
</ol></li>

<li><b>Acquiring your data</b>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>At the moment you can download your network diagrams and maps via
the user interface. If you want to get hold of any other data,
pleasecontact us and we can work something out. We have no
interest in holding onto your data so we can wring money out of
you, and indeed, other than as identified above, are not
interested in the data itself.</li>
</ol></li>

<li><b>Removing Your Data</b>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>At the moment there is no button to delete your user account, but
we can delete it for you if you drop us a line. We are looking to
put in a button to do this, the only reason we haven't yet is that
we're busy people. You can delete projects, maps, and networks
through your user account. When you do this, they are genuinely
deleted in an irrecoverable way.</li>
</ol></li>

<li><b>General</b>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You cannot assign, transfer, charge, sub-contract any of your
rights or obligations under these Terms without us agreeing with
you first.</li>

<li>We may assign, transfer, charge, sub-contract or deal in any other
manner with all or any of our rights or obligations under these
Terms.</li>

<li>These Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or in
connection with them or their subject matter or formation
(including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales
and you agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have
exclusive jurisdiction.</li>
