The heat network editor is the part of THERMOS which lets you design and optimise heat networks. To get into the heat network editor, you need to have created an account, a project, and a map - if these are new ideas to you, have a look at <a href="quick-start.html">the quick start guide</a> first.
</p>

<p>
This document walks through the different bits of the interface, and then describes how to do some common tasks.

The candidates layer of the map shows all of the buildings and roads that are available to put into a heat network.
</p>

<p>
Several different drawing styles are used to show different kinds of information visually on the candidates layer

The candidates list is at the bottom of the window.

<p>
Each candidate building or road that is not <i>forbidden</i> (so is coloured in) is shown as a row in the candidates list.
</p>

<p>
You can sort the candidates list by any of the columns by clicking on the column header. Each column header also has a filter button - this is the grey icon on the right which looks a bit like a funnel 
</p>

<p>
In the leftmost column there is a checkbox for each row, and a checkbox in the column header. These checkboxes control whether candidates are selected. 
</p>

<p>
If you tick the checkbox in the header, all the candidates <i>in the table</i> will be selected. 
</p>

<p>
Together with the filtering controls you can use this to focus on particular candidates

On the right hand side of the map page is the <i>selection info panel</i>.

<p>
From the top:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The white area at the top says how many candidates are selected in total, in this case 5.</li>
<li><p>
The <i>Type</i> row shows the breakdown of the selected candidates by their type. In this case, there are 4 selected buildings and 1 selected path (giving the total of 5).
</p>

<p>
Each of the grey boxes (<i>chips</i>) will let you modify the selection.
If you click on the word in the chip (e.g. On <i>building</i> or <i>path</i>), anything which is <i>not</i> of that type will be <i>deselected</i>.
</p>

<p>
If you click on the the cross at the end of the chip, everything which <i>is</i> of that type will be <i>deselected</i>.
</p></li>
<li>The <i>Classification</i> row gives a breakdown by the candidates' classification. In this example there are four different classifications selected: <code>Service</code>, <code>Connector</code>, <code>Residential</code>, and <code>Industrial</code>. Note that this breakdown is not related to the <i>Type</i> breakdown.</li>
<li>The <i>Constraint</i> row gives a breakdown by the constraint status (colour) of the candidates. Here all 5 candidates are <code>Optional</code></li>
<li>The <i>Length</i> row gives the total length of all selected <i>paths</i></li>
<li>The <i>Base cost</i> row gives a lower bound on the total cost of including all the selected candidates.
For paths, this is the cost of installing a 10mm diameter pipe.
For buildings it is the building connection cost.</li>
<li>The <i>Demand</i> is the summed demand for all the selected buildings</li>
<li>The <i>Peak</i> is the summed peak for all the selected buildings</li>
<li><i>In solution</i> is a breakdown of which candidates the optimiser chose to include in the solution</li>
<li><i>Coincidence</i> is the <i>mean</i> coincidence (aka diversity) factor applied to all the selected paths and supply points. This is probably most useful when selecting a single path or supply.</li>
<li><i>Capacity</i> is the <i>maximum</i> capacity required for all the selected paths and supply points which are in the solution.</li>
<li><i>Diameter</i> is the <i>maximum</i> diameter selected for all the selected paths which are in the solution.</li>
<li><i>Principal</i> is the total capital cost the optimiser has associated with all selected candidates, including the cost of pipes, the capital cost of supply, and the connection cost for buildings.</li>
<li><i>Losses</i> gives the summed heat losses associated with all selected paths that were used in the solution.</li>

<h4 id="org75e68f5"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.5</span> Editing buildings</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-5">
<p>
You can change most of the information the model uses about buildings within a network problem. 
</p>

<p>
When you change a building in this way, the change only applies to the network you are designing - changes like this are not applied to the underlying map. If you start a new network in the same map it will not contain the changes.
</p>

<p>
To edit some buildings (or a single building), first you need to <a href="#selecting">select them</a>. Once you have them selected, you can right click on them on the map and choose <code>Edit buildings</code> or press <b>e</b> on your keyboard. 
</p>

<p>
This will show the editor window:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./img/network/edit-buildings.png" alt="edit-buildings.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This window lets you simultaneously edit the properties of all the selected buildings. 
To make editing a bit easier, the buildings are divided into groups according to the menu at the top. In the picture above, the buildings are grouped according to their <code>Classification</code>. 
</p>

<p>
Each different classification in the selection is shown as a row underneath, so in the example there are three classifications, <code>Unclassified</code>, <code>Residential</code> and <code>Place of worship</code>. The count column shows how many buildings belong to each class.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the window allows you to change the important parameters for each row.
To say you want to change a parameter, you must tick the checkbox next to it. 
Then you can type a value in the corresponding box. This value will be applied to every building in that row.
</p>

<p>
If we made the following changes in the example and pressed OK, the effect would be:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To set the connection cost for 41 unclassified buildings to 8 currency / kWp</li>
<li>To set the demand for the 41 unclassified buildings to 20 MWh/yr</li>
<li>To set the CO2 factor for these buildings to 0.6 kg/kWh</li>
<li>To set the peak demand for 1 place of worship to 100 kW</li>
<li>To set the heat price there to 1 cent per kWh</li>
</ul>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./img/network/edit-buildings-edited.png" alt="edit-buildings-edited.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
At the moment, there is a bit of subtlety around heat price, nox, pm25 and co2.
The starting values are not stored in the map, but instead are configured in the <code>Options</code> page for the whole network.
If you change a building's heat price or emissions factors, then the defaults in the <code>Options</code> page will no longer apply <i>to that building</i>.
</p>

<p>
There is currently not an easy way to tell whether a building is using the default values or has special values of its own.
You can remove any changes made to these parameters, clearing them so that the defaults are used, by right-clicking and choosing <code>Set defaults</code>.

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./img/network/edit-roads.png" alt="edit-roads.png" />

<p>
Changes to these parameters belong to the network problem and do not affect the underlying map, so if you create a new problem in the same map it will not contain changes made in this way.

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Finance and NPV</dt><dd><p>
Costs and revenues are combined to give an NPV, which is what the optimiser tries to maximise. Capital expenditure can also be annutized using a constant-repayment fixed-term loan. The loan repayments are then subject to NPV like other costs. 
</p>

<p>
If you do not want to include a loan for your capital costs, enter <code>1</code> for the financing period at <code>0%</code> interest.
</p></dd>

<dt>Emissions</dt><dd>These parameters set the cost and optionally a limit for total <i>net</i> emissions due to the network. The network's net emissions are the emissions due to the supply <i>minus</i> the avoided emissions from connecting demands.
Supply emissions factors are set as part of the <a href="#org18a04cf">supply parameters</a>, and avoided emissions using either the default factors on the options page, or any <a href="#org75e68f5">building-specific factors</a> you have set.</dd>

<dt>Pipes</dt><dd>These parameters affect the cost of pipes. 
You can set limit for pipe capacity; the model will never try and install a pipe that can carry more than this amount of heat.
The mechanical cost parameters are set here, because they are the same for every pipe.
For the civil cost parameters, you can change the exponent here, but not \(A\) and \(B\); these values are <a href="#org3c70492">set for each path</a>.</dd>

<dt>Temperatures</dt><dd>These parameters control the <a href="calculations.html#pipe-diameter-calc">pipe cost</a> and <a href="calculations.html#pipe-heat-losses">heat loss</a> models.</dd>

<dt>Optimisation parameters</dt><dd>These parameters limit the behaviour of the optimiser; increasing the <i>allowable distance from best possible answer</i> will make the model run faster, but decreasing it may give a better solution. The <i>maximum runtime</i> determines how long the model will spend trying to find a solution before it gives up.</dd>

<dt>Building defaults</dt><dd>These parameters are applied to any buildings which you have not <a href="#org75e68f5">edited</a>, and control the revenue from connecting the building (via the price) and the effect on emissions (via the avoided emissions factors).</dd>
