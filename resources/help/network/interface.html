<h3 id="org592999f"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Resizing and toggling panels</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
The map view is split into three regions: a map, the selection info panel on the right, and the network candidates panel at the bottom.
</p>

<p>
You can change the size of the panels by clicking and dragging on the grey border between them.
</p>

<p>
You can quickly hide or show a panel by clicking on the little arrow button in the middle of the grey border: <img src="./../screenshots/hideshow-button.png" alt="hideshow-button.png" />.

<div id="outline-container-orga87250e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga87250e"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Selecting things</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
The main purpose of the map view is to <i>select</i> candidates (these are buildings or pipe routes), and then to manipulate or investigate them. The <i>selection</i> refers to the set of candidates which are selected at any time.
</p>

<p>
The selection is ephemeral and only one selection exists at a time, much like a selection in a spreadsheet program. There is no quick way to save or recall a selection, so if you want to do something very complicated it is best to do it a bit at a time.
</p>


<div id="org201aa3c" class="figure">
<p><img src="./../screenshots/selected.png" alt="selected.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>Difference in appearance due to selection. On the left nothing is selected, on the right the top-left building is selected.</p>
</div>

<p>
You can see on the map whether something is selected by the style with which it is drawn. Selected buildings are drawn with a darker colour, and selected paths or buildings are drawn with a thicker line.
</p>

<p>
Clicking on a thing with the mouse is the simplest way to select it. This will also deselect whatever is currently selected. Clicking in an empty space will therefore clear the selection.
</p>

<p>
If you want to select several things by clicking on them, you can use <i>modifier keys</i> to change what happens. Holding down a modifier key while clicking will control how the selection is affected:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><b>Shift+click</b></dt><dd>Holding the <b>Shift</b> key while clicking will <b>add</b> whatever is clicked to the selection, without unselecting what was selected before.</dd>
<dt><b>Control+click</b></dt><dd>Holding the <b>Control</b> key while clicking will <b>invert</b> membership of the selection, without changing the rest of the selection. For example if you Control-click something that is in the selection, that thing will be deselected. If you control click something which isn't selected, it will be added to the selection.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
There are other ways to control the selection, which we will come onto in:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="#selecting-with-area">Area selection</a></li>
<li><a href="#selecting-with-chips">Narrowing the selection by category</a></li>

<h4 id="org567cd2e"><span class="section-number-4">2.4.1.</span> Moving the map</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-4-1">

To change the area displayed on the map you can:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Pan</b> by clicking and dragging with the mouse</li>
<li><b>Zoom</b> in and out by
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>clicking the buttons in the top left</li>
<li>scrolling your mouse scroll-wheel if you have one</li>
<li>pressing the <b>-</b> or <b>+</b> keys on the keyboard</li>
<li>holding <b>Shift</b> and then dragging a rectangle on the map</li>

<h4 id="selecting-with-area"><span class="section-number-4">2.4.2.</span> Area selection</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-selecting-with-area">
<p>
You can select several buildings in an area with the area selection buttons, below the zoom buttons.
</p>

<p>
The first one (with a pentagon on it) lets you select using an irregular polygon. Click this to start selecting an area, and then click at points on the map to make a shape.
</p>

<p>
When you click on the last point, every candidate intersecting with the shape will be selected.
</p>

<p>
The second button (with a square on it) lets you select by drawing a rectangle. Click the button, then click the map at the top left and bottom right corners of the rectangle you want to select.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-4-3">
<p>
Below the area selection buttons is the Hide/show forbidden button, illustrated by a grid of four squares. This button will toggle the map between displaying forbidden candidates or not - turning off forbidden candidates may make it easier to focus on your problem once you have decided what is in it.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-4-4">
<p>
This button has a crosshair on it - clicking it will center and zoom the map to the selection, or all non-forbidden candidates if the selection is empty. You can also press the <b>z</b> key for this.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-4-5">
<p>
Next is the connector drawing tool (<img src="./../screenshots/connector-button.png" alt="connector-button.png" />).
</p>

<p>
Clicking this puts the map into a special mode where you can draw new connecting lines. To add a connecting line:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Click the connector drawing tool button</li>
<li><p>
Click on the candidate where you want the line to start - for example on a building whose connector is in the wrong place.
</p>

<p>
The starting candidate will be highlighted with a thick dotted line
</p></li>
<li><p>
Click on any intermediate points on the map you want the connector to go via.
</p>

<p>
As you click the connector will be shown as a dotted line:
</p>

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 5: </span>Halfway through drawing a connector</p>
</div></li>

<li><p>
To finish the connector click where you want it to connect to.
Generally you will want to go from a building to a path, a path to a building, or a path to a path.
</p>

<p>
Connecting two buildings will have no effect unless one is a supply point.
</p>

<p>
To cancel drawing a connector, click the connector tool button rather than finishing the line.
</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-draw-building-tool" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="draw-building-tool"><span class="section-number-4">2.4.6.</span> Draw building</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-draw-building-tool">
<p>
Below the connector drawing button is the button to add a new building. To use it, click the button, and then click where you want the building to go.
</p>

<p>
The new building will always be rendered as a circle, and you will probably immediately want to edit it with the <b>e</b> key or <b>s</b> key since new buildings have no demand or supply information set on them.

<div id="outline-container-org660f3b7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org660f3b7"><span class="section-number-4">2.4.7.</span> Map display controls</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-4-7">
<p>
On the right you can control what is shown on the map.
</p>

<p>
There are two sets of controls:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Controls for the basemap, which is displayed underneath the candidates. This is a single exclusive choice between:
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>None</dt><dd>This displays a blank grey background, which helps the candidates stand out</dd>
<dt>Maps</dt><dd>This displays a black &amp; white cartographic map called <a href="http://maps.stamen.com/toner/">Stamen Toner</a>, which uses OpenStreetMap data</dd>
<dt>Satellite</dt><dd>This displays satellite or aerial imagery from ESRI</dd>
</dl></li>
<li>Controls for what is on top of the basemap, which is a multiple choice of:
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Candidates</dt><dd><p>
the network candidates (buildings and paths).
</p>

<p>
When zoomed out a lot, this will show only buildings and paths from any solution network.
</p></dd>
<dt>Heatmap</dt><dd>an indicative heat density layer drawn on top of the candidates</dd>
<dt>Labels</dt><dd>a layer showing street names (also part of Stamen Toner).</dd>
</dl></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4940a1c" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4940a1c"><span class="section-number-4">2.4.8.</span> Map view / solution display</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-4-8">
<p>
At the bottom of the map is a control which switches the map display between two modes:
</p>


<div id="org10d78ae" class="figure">
<p><img src="./../screenshots/map-view-switch.png" alt="map-view-switch.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 6: </span>Map view control, set to solution display. You can use the <b>Map legend</b> button on the right to get a reminder of what colours on the map indicate.</p>
</div>

<p>
Clicking either of the two buttons on the left of this section change how colour is used in the map.
</p>

<p>
When <b>Constraints</b> is selected, the colours in the map show information about the <i>problem</i>:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Blue elements are optional for inclusion in the network, if they improve the solution</li>
<li>Red elements are required to be included in the network, whether or not this improves the solution</li>
<li>Supply sites are coloured in orange</li>
<li>Everything else is forbidden</li>
</ul>

<p>
However when there is a solution and <b>Solution</b> is selected, the map changes to show information about that solution. In this case:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Red elements are in the network</li>
<li>Yellow elements are peripheral pipes, reachable by the network but not useful</li>
<li>Magenta elements are not reachable from any supply location, so could never be connected</li>
<li>Green elements have alternative heating systems selected (when the objective allows this)</li>
<li>Supplies that have been built are coloured in orange</li>
<li>Everything else is drawn in grey</li>
</ul>

<p>
To the right of these you can also toggle whether to show pipe sizes.
</p>

<p>
This will scale the thickness of line used according to pipe diameter, making bigger pipes draw with thicker lines. This can help you see the network structure on the map.

The selection info panel is the region on the right hand side of the map view. Typically it will look something like this:
</p>


<div id="org3de0277" class="figure">

<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 7: </span>Example of the selection info panel. The <b>Category</b> and <b>Name</b> rows are elided.</p>
</div>

<p>
This panel tells you all about the currently selected candidates.
At the top, you can see how many candidates are selected.
</p>

<p>
Below that are a number of rows - which rows are visible will depend on what is selected. Each row has a label on the left, and information on the right.
</p>

<p>
These rows typically display two types of information: <i>categorical</i> values or <i>numeric</i> ones. Categories are displayed as a series of <i>chips</i>, where each chip indicates how many of the selected candidates fall into that category.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes category rows are elided, to keep the panel short. For example in the image above <b>Category</b> and <b>Name</b> are elided. Clicking on the triangular arrow by the label will show or hide the different categories.
</p>

<p>
Numerical values are aggregated up in a sensible way, depending on what is being displayed - some will be summed up, others averaged and so on. Most numerical values will show you some more detail (min, max, etc) if you hover the mouse over the value - this is usually indicated by a little superscript blue letter <code>i</code>.

Sometimes you may want the model to connect a set of buildings all together or not at all - this could represent a development that has several buildings in it, for example. It can also help simplify the optimisation problem, as the optimiser has fewer decisions to make.
</p>

<p>
Each building can belong to a single group of buildings - the optimiser will treat that group as a single decision.

The model has two main objectives, selectable on the objective page in the sidebar:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Maximise network NPV
</p>

<p>
In this mode, the goal is to choose which demands to connect to the network so as to maximize the NPV for the network operator. This is the sum of the revenues from demands minus the sum of costs for the network.
</p>

<p>
The impact of non-network factors (individual systems, insulation, and emissions costs) can be accounted for using the <a href="#concept-market-tariff">market tariff</a>, which chooses a price to beat the best non-network system.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Maximise whole-system NPV
</p>

<p>
In this mode, the goal is to choose how to supply heat to the buildings in the problem (or abate demand) at the minimum overall cost. The internal transfer of money between buildings and network operator is not considered, so there are no network revenues and tariffs have no effect.
</p>

<p>
Under this you can control whether or not to
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Offer insulation measures</li>
<li>Offer other heating systems</li>

<p>
These choices are not relevant when maximizing network NPV, because they can never improve the network operator's NPV so would never be chosen.

<div id="outline-container-orgf70a92c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf70a92c"><span class="section-number-3">3.3.</span> Capital costs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
Capital costs have two types of special treatment:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Annualizing</dt><dd>capital costs can be annualized, which means converting them into a fixed repayment loan</dd>
<dt>Recurrence</dt><dd>capital costs can recur, which means that the equipment they represent needs replacing every so often, so the original capital cost is incurred again after this time.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The capital costs section lets you control for each part of a solution:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Whether it should be annualized and whether it should recur</li>
<li><p>
If so, a period and a rate.
</p>

<p>
The period is used to determine both the term of the annualizing loan, if enabled, and the replacement period if the capital cost is set to recur.
</p>

<p>
The rate is used to determine the repayments on the loan, if annualizing is enabled.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
If both annualizing and recurrence are enabled, the recurring payments will themselves be annualized, turning the capital costs into a repeating equal yearly cost.
</p>

<p>
Future payments due to annualizing or recurrence are discounted in the same way as other future costs.

<p>
Emissions costs are applied in both whole-system and network NPV modes to anything within the objective which produces emissions. These are things for which you can set emissions factors.
</p>

<p>
Emissions limits are hard constraints on the solution - if enabled, the optimisation will not be allowed to produce a result where emissions exceed the annual limit.

Often it will be easier for the optimiser to find a good solution if you express emissions goals using costs rather than hard limits.

There are three controls displayed for computing resources:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Distance from optimum
</p>

<p>
Also known as MIP gap, this tells the optimiser to stop work if it finds a solution which it can prove is within this percentage of the best possible solution.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Effect of parameter fixing
</p>

<p>
The optimisation involves making an estimate of some key parameters, solving a question assuming these estimates, and then looking at the result to see how good the estimate turned out to be. Here you can tell the optimisation that if this guessing is fairly close to the mark, it might as well stop
</p></li>

<li><p>
Maximum runtime
</p>

<p>
This setting says how long you are willing to wait for an answer. If the optimisation reaches this time limit without stopping because of the previous two settings, it will terminate. In this case you may get no solution, or you may get a solution whose distance from optimum is worse than the limit you have entered.

The <i>market tariff</i> is a special tariff whose price is dynamically determined from the other options available to a building.

When a building is offered the market tariff, the model will decide a price by looking for each individual system <a href="#editing-systems">marked as available to the building</a> at what unit rate for heat has the same NPV as that system (including considering insulation). The market rate is then selected to be the cheapest of these rates, minus a bit (the <i>stickiness</i>) to account for the nuisance of switching.

<dt>Capacity</dt><dd>The power that can be transmitted by a flow/return pair of this nominal bore. If you don't fill this in, the cell will show THERMOS' estimate, which is controlled by the capacity &amp; loss model below.</dd>
<dt>Losses</dt><dd>The heat losses THERMOS estimates for a flow/return pair per meter. Again, you can enter your own values here, or use the computed values THERMOS estimates.</dd>

In a heat network, pumping overheads offset some heat output from the plant, since the waste heat produced is still useful. In a cold network the opposite is true, and pumping overheads are added to the output needed from the plant.

</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Name</dt><dd>this is just descriptive text</dd>
<dt>Applies to</dt><dd>this is the surface the insulation applies to. THERMOS estimates the available area for insulation using the building's footprint, height, and exposed perimeter.

<dt>Maximum area</dt><dd>this determines the maximum insulatable area as a percentage of the overall area (described above under <b>Applies to</b>). This is to represent things like windows and doors in walls, which would not be covered by insulation.</dd>

<p>
In network NPV mode, the model will only use individual system definitions when computing the rate for the <a href="#concept-market-tariff">market tariff</a>.

<dt>Variable capex</dt><dd>If this system is installed in a building, this capacity-related capital cost is paid per kW of peak demand in the building.</dd>
<dt>Tank factor</dt><dd><p>
THERMOS' default peak demand estimates include hot water demand, which makes up most of the peak. This is because heat networks typically provide hot water direct through the heat exchanger, rather than by charging a storage tank.
</p>

<p>
However, some individual systems do use a hot water tank, and so require a lower peak output. This is represented in THERMOS by the 'tank factor', which is a multiple of the base heat output.
</p>

<p>
For example, say a building uses 20MWh/yr of heat. Changing the units for this to kW you get about 2.3 kW as the minimum possible peak value (if it were uniformly spread out).
</p>

<p>
With tank factor set to 1, the peak would be 2.3kW; with tank factor set to 2, it would be 4.6 kW, and so on.
</p>

<p>
A realistic value for a domestic building is probably in the region of 6.
</p></dd>
<dt>Emissions factors</dt><dd><p>
These factors determine the emissions per unit heat produced by the individual system; like the heat cost, you will need to roll any conversion efficiency from fuel into these factors yourself.

This page shows some technical information about the optimisation itself. The values displayed are:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Objective value</dt><dd>This is the objective value as seen by the optimiser <i>after</i> correcting the diversity and heat loss parameters, but without rounding up pipe diameters.</dd>
<dt>Runtime</dt><dd>The time spent in the optimiser</dd>
<dt>Iterations</dt><dd>The number of mixed-integer programs solved</dd>
<dt>Iteration range</dt><dd>The range in objective value encountered while iterating to find good parameters.</dd>
<dt>Gap</dt><dd>The MIP gap; this is an upper bound on how close the optimiser is to finding the best possible solution; if zero, the solution is optimal. However, this number is confounded by the effect of parameter fixing. The value shown is the gap for the solution based on estimated parameters.</dd>
<dt>Bounds</dt><dd>These are the bounds on the optimum value of the best solution found, again confounded by parameter estimation. The true optimum is probably somewhere in this range. Note that the <b>objective value</b> shown above may lie <i>outside</i> this range because it is the value for a slightly different problem in which the parameters have been re-estimated.</dd>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Tariffs</li>

<p>
When you upload a spreadsheet the application will show a dialog asking what parameters you want to use and two other questions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Whether to use new parameters where names match</li>
<li>Whether to keep old parameters with different names</li>
</ul>

<p>
These settings control how existing relationships between buildings and parameters are affected by an upload.
</p>

<p>
For example, if you have some paths with a civil cost of "Hard Dig" in your problem and you upload a spreadsheet and select to use the pipe costs data, the possible outcomes are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>If</i> the uploaded spreadsheet contains a civil cost called "Hard Dig" as well:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>If</i> you have selected to new parameters where names match

<li><i>If</i> you have selected <i>not</i> to use new parameters where names match
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Existing assignments to "Hard Dig" will be cleared</li>

THERMOS is an optimising model which means it makes some decisions.
</p>

<p>
The main decision is whether to put something in a heat network.

<p>
The constraint status of an item affects whether the optimiser can or must use it in a network.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If the status is forbidden, the item is ignored</li>
<li>If the status is optional, the item will be included in a network if that is an improvement on any alternative</li>

<h3 id="concept-civils"><span class="section-number-3">11.4.</span> Civil costs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-concept-civils">
<p>
Civil engineering costs are one of the costs associated with installing a pipe.
</p>

<p>
They are to do with digging a hole and filling it back in and making good, so they are affected by the surface being dug, the location of the dig and so on.
</p>

<p>
They don't include the cost that is the same anywhere in a city: this is the cost of the pipe and mechanical engineering (welding etc) required to fit the pipe.

<h3 id="concept-concost"><span class="section-number-3">11.5.</span> Connection costs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-concept-concost">
<p>
Connection costs represent the cost of all the equipment required within a building to connect it to a heat network.

Typically this would be a heat exchanger, and maybe some internal pipework.

<h3 id="concept-demand"><span class="section-number-3">11.6.</span> Annual and peak demand</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-concept-demand">
<p>
THERMOS' network model considers only two types of demand:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The annual demand in kWh/yr</li>
<li>The peak demand in kW</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is because, by and large, a network connection's size is determined by peak demand, and its operations are determined by annual demand.

<div id="outline-container-concept-tank-factor" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="concept-tank-factor"><span class="section-number-3">11.7.</span> Tank factor</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-concept-tank-factor">
<p>
THERMOS includes an invented quantity called the "Tank factor".
</p>

<p>
This exists to reflect the fact that whilst heat network connections are usually sized for hot water production on demand, other heating systems are not. Heat pumps, for example, would have to be very large to deliver the ~20-30 kW of heat needed for instant hot water.
</p>

<p>
These systems are instead installed with a hot water tank which acts as storage.
</p>

<p>
The tank factor is used to adjust the peak demand for these systems, by expressing it as a multiple of the minimum possible peak demand (i.e. the annual demand expressed in kW).
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-concept-heat-loss" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="concept-heat-loss"><span class="section-number-3">11.8.</span> Pipe heat loss</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-concept-heat-loss">
<p>
Heat network pipes lose heat into the the ground, because they are warmer than the ground.
</p>

<p>
In THERMOS you can either enter your own losses per metre, or use the built-in model.
</p>

<p>
If you use the built-in model you probably want to set the ground temperature. If this is higher, the heat losses will be reduced.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-concept-diversity" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="concept-diversity"><span class="section-number-3">11.9.</span> Diversity / coincidence</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-concept-diversity">
<p>
Load diversity and coincidence are two sides of the same coin.
</p>

<p>
As mentioned above, heat networks are usually sized for hot water.
</p>

<p>
When there are several buildings connected to a network, it is not often a requirement for them all to have hot water on demand at the same time, because hot water usage is a bit stochastic (moreso than heat usage).
</p>

<p>
Diversity or coincidence is a factor used to approximate this effect.
</p>

<p>
For example if two buildings have a peak demand of 30kW, we might only supply them using a shared pipe with capacity to deliver 48kW, which is not 30kW + 30kW. This would be a coincidence of 80% - we only size for 80% of the shared demand.

<div id="outline-container-concept-objective" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="concept-objective"><span class="section-number-3">11.10.</span> Objective</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-concept-objective">
<p>
The objective is the technical term for a number that the model is trying to make as large as possible.
</p>

<p>
For THERMOS this number is always the present value (or minus the present cost).
</p>

<p>
In network NPV mode it is the present value to the network operator of their revenues less their costs.
</p>

<p>
In whole-system mode it is minus the present cost of all the costs of delivering the heat.
