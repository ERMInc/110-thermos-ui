   - To prevent overuse of storage space:
     - Each project shall have a last access date
     - When a project hasn't been looked at for N days, there will be a warning

   - User accounts
     - No login for N days, warning, N+x delete

   - Compute limits
     - Maximum runtime upper bound
     - Rate limit on jobs run
     - Rate limit on maps created
     - Maximum runtime per day?
     - Max uploaded GIS file feature count
* TODO Anti-forgery tokens are off                                      :bug:
