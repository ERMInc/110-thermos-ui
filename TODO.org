#+TITLE: THERMOS TODO List
#+CATEGORY: THERMOS

This is the list of things to do with THERMOS as a whole system, although it is in the UI repository.

* DONE [#A] Steam modelling
- [X] Implement power/diameter relationship
- [X] Implement diameter/losses relationship

  Marc says to just multiply the heat loss by the insulation factor,
  so it's an impedance of some sort.
- [X] Bounds checking in the UI for diameter
** TODO Update documentation
* DONE [#A] Discrete pipe sizes
- [X] Do something about default dig cost
- [X] Make migration box go on top of everything, not just map
- [X] Pipe size table editor
- [X] Fix model interop to have appropriate cost inputs
- [X] Fix editor to use dig costs from new location
- [X] Fix editor to reflect new pipe cost information
- [X] Fix output processing to round up pipe sizes
- [X] Fix reporting to report on exact pipe sizes
- [X] Remove references to old stuff
- [X] Migrate old scenarios to have a table rather than equations
** DONE Update documentation
* DONE [#A] Output reporting information to spreadsheets
* DONE [#A] Highlight modified objects
* TODO [#A] Publish with an open-source license
Me to write something about attribution requirement.
* TODO Uploadable LIDAR for projects
* TODO Improved table view
* TODO Degree day link up
* TODO Supply location guesser button
* TODO A little model for supply emissions factors / fuel mix in network editor
* TODO A way to reuse parameters between problems
* TODO A constraint on the number of supply locations included in a result
* TODO Better run-log information
* TODO Better handling of running out of time
* TODO Switch to solution view when recv. result
* TODO Nerf standard users, make special users
   - To prevent overuse of storage space:
     - Each project shall have a last access date
     - When a project hasn't been looked at for N days, there will be a warning
     - When a project hasn't been looked at for N+x days, it gets deleted

   - User accounts
     - No login for N days, warning, N+x delete

   - Compute limits
     - Maximum runtime upper bound
     - Rate limit on jobs run
     - Rate limit on maps created
     - Maximum runtime per day?
     - Max uploaded GIS file feature count
* TODO Capital costs box in objective page is not showing PV etc.       :bug:
* TODO Anti-forgery tokens are off                                      :bug:
As part of this, could use the effects system in flow.
* TODO Individual system capacity NaN?                                  :bug:
http://localhost:8080/project/5/map/20/net/1190
* TODO Unreachable detection doesn't know heat can't flow through a building :bug:
* DONE Show pipe sizes default to "on" in solution view
* DONE Kick map element when it is resized, with a resizeobserver
* DONE [#A] Increase & check zoom limits
* DONE Attribution statements for tiles
* DONE Backport any fixes to flow
There is the effects system but not using that yet.
* DONE Backport fixes to splitter
