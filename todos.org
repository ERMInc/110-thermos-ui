This is simpler than I thought; can use ReactDOM/rehydrate and it mostly works.
There is some stuff about exactly matching text nodes that needs thought

* TODO Look into better serverside rendering

Is there some way I can make client-side event handlers not a source of trouble?
At the moment, :on-click #(js/foo) will break on the server side.

Transforming the hiccup input server-side would work but any server-side component that contains this stuff would need to go through said macro.

This is probably roughly acceptable with a bit of work.

Alternatively use someone else's thing (rum) which allegedly works already.
