#+TITLE: Using the heat network editor
#+AUTHOR: CSE

The heat network editor is the part of THERMOS which lets you design and optimise heat networks. To get into the heat network editor, you need to have created an account, a project, and a map - if these are new ideas to you, have a look at [[file:quick-start.org][the quick start guide]] first.

This document walks through the different bits of the interface, and then describes how to do some common tasks.

* Parts of the interface

The editor is divided into several pages which you can switch between using the buttons at the top of the window.

** Map page

The map page shows the /candidates/ (bits of roads and buildings) which are available to put into a network. It looks like this - you can point at things in the picture to show quick descriptions.

*** Candidates layer

The candidates layer of the map shows all of the buildings and roads that are available to put into a heat network.

Several different drawing styles are used to show different kinds of information visually on the candidates layer


- Colour :: the colour of each candidate is used to show information about whether the candidate will be used in a network.
            #+ATTR_HTML: :style float:right;
            [[./img/network/map-colours.png]]

  - *Grey* candidates are /forbidden/, which means they can't be included in a network
  - *Blue* candidates are /optional/, which means they can be included in a network, but the optimiser can leave them out if they make things worse.

    If the optimiser has been run and there is a solution then blue candidates are those which /were included/ in the network.
  - *Green* candidates are optional candidates which were /not/ included in the network, if there is a solution
  - *Red* candidates are /required/, which means that the optimiser /has/ to put them in the network.
  - *Magenta* candidates are /infeasible/, which means that they cannot be used in a solution, for example because
    - They are buildings or roads that cannot be reached from any supply point
    - They are roads that do not join any pairs of buildings so would not be worth using
- Fill :: buildings which are supply locations are filled in with a striped pattern.
          If the optimiser has been run, and the supply is used, the stripes will be coloured in blue.
- Line thickness :: The line thickness is used to show whether a candidate is /selected/. 
                    Selected candidates are drawn with a thicker line.
                    They are also shown with a tick mark in the candidate list, and summarised in the selection info box.
                    #+CAPTION: A required and forbidden building and some forbidden roads are all selected
                    [[./img/network/map-selection.png]]

- Transparency :: If the candidate list at the bottom has been /filtered/, the candidates which do not pass the filter will be made mostly transparent, to emphasise the things shown in the candidate list.

*** Density layer

The heat density layer shows a smoothed version of where there is heat demand in a map.
It may be a useful way to get an overview of the distribution of demand when you are zoomed out too far to see the individual buildings and roads
