#+TITLE: Using the heat network editor
#+AUTHOR: CSE

The heat network editor is the part of THERMOS which lets you design and optimise heat networks. To get into the heat network editor, you need to have created an account, a project, and a map - if these are new ideas to you, have a look at [[file:quick-start.org][the quick start guide]] first.

This document walks through the different bits of the interface, and then describes how to do some common tasks.

* Parts of the interface

The editor is divided into several pages which you can switch between using the buttons at the top of the window.

** Map page

The map page shows the /candidates/ (bits of roads and buildings) which are available to put into a network. It looks like this - you can point at some of the main things in the picture to show quick descriptions.

[[./img/network/tooltips.svg]]

*** Candidates layer

The candidates layer of the map shows all of the buildings and roads that are available to put into a heat network.

Several different drawing styles are used to show different kinds of information visually on the candidates layer


- Colour :: the colour of each candidate is used to show information about whether the candidate will be used in a network.
            #+ATTR_HTML: :style float:right;
            [[./img/network/map-colours.png]]

  - *Grey* candidates are /forbidden/, which means they can't be included in a network
  - *Blue* candidates are /optional/, which means they can be included in a network, but the optimiser can leave them out if they make things worse.

    If the optimiser has been run and there is a solution then blue candidates are those which /were included/ in the network.
  - *Green* candidates are optional candidates which were /not/ included in the network, if there is a solution
  - *Red* candidates are /required/, which means that the optimiser /has/ to put them in the network.
  - *Magenta* candidates are /infeasible/, which means that they cannot be used in a solution, for example because
    - They are buildings or roads that cannot be reached from any supply point
    - They are roads that do not join any pairs of buildings so would not be worth using
- Fill :: buildings which are supply locations are filled in with a striped pattern.
          If the optimiser has been run, and the supply is used, the stripes will be coloured in blue.
- Line thickness :: The line thickness is used to show whether a candidate is /selected/. 
                    Selected candidates are drawn with a thicker line.
                    They are also shown with a tick mark in the candidate list, and summarised in the selection info box.

                    [[./img/network/map-selection.png]]

- Transparency :: If the candidate list at the bottom has been /filtered/, the candidates which do not pass the filter will be made mostly transparent, to emphasise the things shown in the candidate list.

*** Density layer

The heat density layer shows a smoothed version of where there is heat demand in a map.
It may be a useful way to get an overview of the distribution of demand when you are zoomed out too far to see the individual buildings and roads

*** Candidates list

The candidates list is at the bottom of the window.

Each candidate building or road that is not /forbidden/ (so is coloured in) is shown as a row in the candidates list.

You can sort the candidates list by any of the columns by clicking on the column header. Each column header also has a filter button - this is the grey icon on the right which looks a bit like a funnel 

In the leftmost column there is a checkbox for each row, and a checkbox in the column header. These checkboxes control whether candidates are selected. 

If you tick the checkbox in the header, all the candidates /in the table/ will be selected. 

Together with the filtering controls you can use this to focus on particular candidates

#+ATTR_HTML: :autoplay true :loop true :controls true
#+CAPTION: Filtering and selecting from the candidates list. When a column has been filtered, its filter button turns blue. Filtered candidates become transparent on the map. Checking the selection box selects the filtered candidates only.
[[./img/network/filter-table.webm]]

*** Selection panel

On the right hand side of the map page is the /selection info panel/.
This shows summary information about whatever candidates are selected on the map.

Here is a picture illustrating most of what you might see in the selection info panel:

#+ATTR_HTML: :style float:right;padding-left:1em;
[[./img/network/selection-info-panel.png]]

From the top:

- The white area at the top says how many candidates are selected in total, in this case 5.
- The /Type/ row shows the breakdown of the selected candidates by their type. In this case, there are 4 selected buildings and 1 selected path (giving the total of 5).

  Each of the grey boxes (/chips/) will let you modify the selection.
  If you click on the word in the chip (e.g. On /building/ or /path/), anything which is /not/ of that type will be /deselected/.

  If you click on the the cross at the end of the chip, everything which /is/ of that type will be /deselected/.
- The /Classification/ row gives a breakdown by the candidates' classification. In this example there are four different classifications selected: ~Service~, ~Connector~, ~Residential~, and ~Industrial~. Note that this breakdown is not related to the /Type/ breakdown.
- The /Constraint/ row gives a breakdown by the constraint status (colour) of the candidates. Here all 5 candidates are ~Optional~
- The /Length/ row gives the total length of all selected /paths/
- The /Base cost/ row gives a lower bound on the total cost of including all the selected candidates.
  For paths, this is the cost of installing a 10mm diameter pipe.
  For buildings it is the building connection cost.
- The /Demand/ is the summed demand for all the selected buildings
- The /Peak/ is the summed peak for all the selected buildings
- /In solution/ is a breakdown of which candidates the optimiser chose to include in the solution
- /Coincidence/ is the /mean/ coincidence (aka diversity) factor applied to all the selected paths and supply points. This is probably most useful when selecting a single path or supply.
- /Capacity/ is the /maximum/ capacity required for all the selected paths and supply points which are in the solution.
- /Diameter/ is the /maximum/ diameter selected for all the selected paths which are in the solution.
- /Principal/ is the total capital cost the optimiser has associated with all selected candidates, including the cost of pipes, the capital cost of supply, and the connection cost for buildings.
- /Losses/ gives the summed heat losses associated with all selected paths that were used in the solution.

*** Selecting things
*** Editing buildings

You can change most of the information the model uses about buildings within a network problem. 

When you change a building in this way, the change only applies to the network you are designing - changes like this are not applied to the underlying map. If you start a new network in the same map it will not contain the changes.

To edit some buildings (or a single building), first you need to [[Selecting things][select them]]. Once you have them selected, you can right click on them on the map and choose ~Edit buildings~.

*** Editing paths
*** Editing supply parameters
*** Keyboard shortcuts

You can do some common operations with the keyboard using these shortcuts:

| Key | Effect                                               |
|-----+------------------------------------------------------|
| *c* | Change the constraint for the selection              |
| *s* | Change the supply parameters for the selection       |
| *z* | Move the map to show the selection or the network    |
| *a* | Select everything in the candidate list              |
| *A* | Invert the selection (so *a A* clears the selection) |
| *e* | Edit the parameters for the selection                |
| *i* | Show some debugging information                      |
