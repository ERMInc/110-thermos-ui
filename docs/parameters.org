#+TITLE: THERMOS parameter index
#+AUTHOR: CSE

This document contains a list of the important you can tell THERMOS, what they mean, and where you might get them. 

* Facts about buildings

These parameters are mostly used when creating a map (see [[file:maps.org][here]] for more).

** Annual demand

The annual demand for heat in a building, in kWh.

Every building in a map has a value associated with it for annual demand
The value is placed on the building when the map is created, either using a known user input, a benchmark estimate, or the THERMOS heat demand model.

You can edit this demand directly in a network problem by right clicking on a building and selecting ~Edit buildings~. The edit will not change the map, only that problem.

This value affects:

- the revenue for providing heat to the building
- the avoided emissions by providing heat to the building
- the cost of supplying heat into the network

** Peak demand

The peak demand for heat in a building, in kW.

Every building in a map has a value associated with it for peak demand.
The value is placed on the building when the map is created, either using a known user input, a user input peak-to-base ratio, or the THERMOS heat demand model.

You can edit the peak directly in a network problem by right clicking on a building and selecting ~Edit buildings~. The edit will not change the map, only that problem.

This value affects:

- the size (and hence cost) of pipes needed to supply the building
- the size (and hence cost) of the plant needed to supply the network
- the connection costs for the building
