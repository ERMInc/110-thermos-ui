<p>
The home page does not do very much; the important parts are
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The top bar, containing
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Settings</b>, which will let you change how THERMOS shows your name, change your password, and select whether you want to receive emails from the system</li>
<li><b>Help</b>, which you are looking at right now</li>
<li><b>Forum</b>, which links to a discussion forum in which you can ask questions</li>
<li><b>Logout</b> which is self-explanatory</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A description of your user account level (in some cases), which shows how much of your limited server resources you have used up,</li>
<li>The button to create a new project, and</li>

<h2 id="org79201f2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Project pages</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
From the home page you can reach the project page for each project, which will look something like this:
</p>


<div id="orgb0c62ad" class="figure">
<p><img src="./screenshots/project-buttons.png" alt="project-buttons.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>A project page with a map in it</p>
</div>

<p>
Project pages always have a bar at the top, whose controls pertain to the project:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>N User(s)</dt><dd>The users button lets you see and perhaps control who has access to the project. More on this below.</dd>
<dt>Delete</dt><dd>This will delete the project entirely.</dd>
<dt>Leave</dt><dd>This will remove you from the project, but not delete it. You will no longer be able to access the project. The button is only displayed if there are other users than you on the project.</dd>
<dt>Map +</dt><dd>This button lets you add a map. More on this below.</dd>
<dt>LIDAR</dt><dd>This lets you add LIDAR to the project, which will make better maps. More on this below too.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Some of these controls will not be shown if you do not have permission to change the project.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org986d80f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org986d80f"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Changing user access to projects</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
If you click on the users button on a project page you can change who can view a project. However you must be the project admin to do this. Whoever creates a project is an admin for that project, and any admin can make any other user an admin.
</p>


<div id="orgcfb16c1" class="figure">
<p><img src="./screenshots/project-users.png" alt="project-users.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 3: </span>Project participants box.</p>
</div>

<p>
In the project participants box you can add, remove, promote and demote users on the project.
The ↑ and ↓ buttons promote a user to or from being a project admin. The red cross button will remove a user, and the add button will add users whose usernames / email addresses are listed in the box on the left.
</p>

<p>
Finally at the bottom is a tickbox to make a project <b>globally visible</b>. If you tick this box, then you can share the URL for the project with anyone and they will be able to see the maps and networks it contains (whether or not they have a login on the THERMOS system).
</p>

<p>
People who don't know the URL will not be able to see the project, but URLs are not hard to guess as they contain sequentially generated numbers, so you should not rely on this to secure any important data.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org97c7969" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org97c7969"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Creating maps</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
You can create a map from OpenStreetMap data, or from your own GIS data.
</p>

<p>
Once a map is created, its contents are fixed and will not change.
</p>

<p>
You can modify things from the map within the network editor, but this change is only in the network problem you have created, not in the underlying map.
</p>

<p>
To start making a map click <b>Map +</b> on the project page. This will take you to a step-by-step process for map creation.
</p>

<p>
The first page is just for a name and description, but it's useful to show a picture as it illustrates something else:
</p>


<div id="org6b96a55" class="figure">

<h3 id="orgdb20582"><span class="section-number-3">4.1</span> Spatial data</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
After the name page you must acquire spatial data for the map.
There are two options here:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Use OpenStreetMap (OSM)</li>
<li>Upload your own GIS files</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 5: </span>Creating a map from OSM. Use the search box or controls on the left to select an area to load the map from.</p>
</div>

<p>
Using OSM is easiest, but you are restricted by how well mapped the area you're interested in is. Some OSM tags (the OSM term for data fields) are used when loading data:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>landuse</code> <code>building</code> and <code>amenity</code> tags are used to populate THERMOS' category field</li>
<li>the <code>height</code> and <code>building:levels</code> tags are used as inputs to the demand model, if LIDAR is not available</li>
<li>the <code>name</code> field is used to populate THERMOS' name field. This is often a street or building name.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The application will only let you load a certain area from OSM at once. If the area you have selected is too large, you won't be able to continue to the next step.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9c7da78" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9c7da78"><span class="section-number-3">4.3</span> Using GIS data</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
If you have your own GIS data you can upload that instead of using OSM.
</p>


<div id="orgb31f631" class="figure">
<p><img src="./screenshots/create-map-gis.png" alt="create-map-gis.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 6: </span>Uploading GIS data.</p>
</div>

<p>
You can do this by dragging and dropping data in one of the supported formats into the dotted rectangle. When you do this a progress bar will be shown for each file as it is uploaded. Once they are uploaded and each row is green, you can continue. All the geometry GIS files you upload will be added into the map.
</p>

<p>
If the GIS files contain linestring or multilinestring data, these geometries will be used for potential pipe routes. All other geometries will be assumed to be buildings.
</p>

<p>
If you have no linestring or multilinestring data, the box to <b>Also import roads from OpenStreetMap</b> will be checked; in this case OSM is queried for roads and footpaths in the same area to use for pipe routes. Otherwise, the box will be unchecked, but you can check it yourself if you want to use OSM paths as well as what is in your GIS data.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="org638da69"><span class="section-number-3">4.4</span> Using fields in GIS data</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-4">
<p>
Your GIS data may contain other fields than just geometry. Some of these may have special meaning that THERMOS could make use of, and you might also want to keep some to view in the network editor.

</p>

<dl class="org-dl">

The <b>Guess</b> button in the top right will give fields meanings based on the field name.

<h3 id="new-map-lidar"><span class="section-number-3">4.6</span> Check LIDAR coverage</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-new-map-lidar">
<p>
When creating a map from OSM or GIS data THERMOS will use any LIDAR information it has to try and determine building size. This will improve the quality of the model's heat demand estimates.
</p>

<p>
THERMOS takes LIDAR from two places
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A list of LIDAR files associated with the project</li>
<li>A list of LIDAR files that are available for all projects</li>
</ol>

<p>
After uploading map data you will see a section like this:
</p>


<div id="org760962c" class="figure">
<p><img src="./screenshots/create-map-lidar.png" alt="create-map-lidar.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 8: </span>Checking LIDAR coverage. We have uploaded data in the blue rectangle in the top left. Unfortunately the LIDAR coverage in the system is in the pink area in the bottom right, so the demand estimates will be poor unless we upload some LIDAR for the area we are using.</p>
</div>

<p>
The map shows where the map is to cover in blue, any project-specific LIDAR areas in green, and any other LIDAR In pink.
</p>

<p>
At this stage if you have some LIDAR that covers the area you are mapping and it isn't already covered, uploading that LIDAR will help THERMOS' demand model with its estimates.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org5a892fd" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5a892fd"><span class="section-number-3">4.7</span> Other parameters</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-7">
<p>
<img src="./screenshots/create-map-other.png" alt="create-map-other.png" />
Once you have checked and uploaded any LIDAR, you're nearly there. You will see a section like the above, in which you can enter a heating degree days number to calibrate the demand model, and choose whether to set up some initial building groups.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org96af93b" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org96af93b"><span class="section-number-4">4.7.1</span> Heating degree days</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-7-1">
<p>
The THERMOS demand model bases its predictions on building size and shape, but these need to be calibrated geographically using heating degree days (HDD) for the area. THERMOS will try and estimate an HDD value using data from Eurostat (more details <a href="heating-degree-days.html">here</a>) if it can. Otherwise you will need to find your own value.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org5ccbfcc" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org5ccbfcc"><span class="section-number-4">4.7.2</span> Automatic building groups</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-7-2">
<p>
The THERMOS network can put buildings into groups. Either every building in a group gets connected or none does. You can create and change groups yourself <a href="network/interface.html">using the network editor</a>.
</p>

<p>
The option here lets you set them up automatically in the map by the path they are connected to. You can either group by road segment, or (if using GIS data) any field that is on the paths. Grouping by road segment will make all buildings which get connected to the same segment of road belong to the same group. A segment of road is any section which does not have a junction in it with another road.
</p>

<p>
Grouping by another field simply groups together all buildings for which their connected road has the same value in the given field.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">

Each time you save or run the model a new network problem is saved on the server. These problems do not replace one another, so old saves are still available.

</p>

<ul class="org-ul">

</p>

<p>
A tick means that this specific save has been optimised, a spinning THERMOS icon shows it's running, and anything else indicates that save has not been run. If it contains a solution, the solution is from a previous save.
